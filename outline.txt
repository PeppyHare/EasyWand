Code outline for c++ implementation of easyWand:

easyWand object
    - Constructor
        - Default cameras object
        - Default wand length
    - Store calibration wand length
    - Method for reading in a wand points file
        - Stored as a vector
        - Ability to remove un-digitized points (NaNs)
    - Method for reading in a camera profile file
        - Create camera object
    - Method for reading in background points
        - Stored as a vector
    - Calibration method
    - Method for saving results to file
        - Separate camera profile / reconstructed points files?
    - Method for visualization of 2D wand points
    - Method for visualization of 3D reconstruction

camera object  nop.
    - Store resolution as array
    - Store number of cameras (int)
    ( - Later, store undistortion parameters)
