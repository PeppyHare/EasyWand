###### EASYWAND C++ VERSION!
===============================================================================
    This is a C++ implementation of a MATLAB project I previously contributed to.  EasyWand is meant to be a user-friendly camera calibration toolbox, largely geared towards academic use.  

## Necessary Installs:
    At this point, it's necessary to have installed [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/).  Soon, these will be bundled along with the install, and everything will be nicer.  Until I'm much better with CMake, you're on your own.

## Quickstart Guide:
There is some sample data sitting right in the top-level directory.  There is a sample camera calibration profile file (RGBsetup_profile.txt), a sample set of digitized calibration points (wandpts.csv), and a set of background points (bkgdpts.csv).  Usage will probably change violently over the next few weeks, so just take a peek at the source.
